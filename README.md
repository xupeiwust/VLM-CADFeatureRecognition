# VLM-CADFeatureRecognition

This repository contains the code and resources accompanying the paper "[Leveraging Vision-Language Models for Manufacturing Feature Recognition in CAD Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02810)". The study explores the application of vision-language models (VLMs) to automate the recognition of various manufacturing features in CAD designs without extensive training datasets or predefined rules.

## Overview

Automatic Feature Recognition (AFR) is crucial for converting design knowledge into actionable manufacturing information. Traditional AFR methods often rely on predefined geometric rules and large datasets, which can be time-consuming and may lack generalizability across different manufacturing features. This project investigates the use of VLMs, employing prompt engineering techniques such as multi-view query images, few-shot learning, sequential reasoning, and chain-of-thought, to recognize a wide range of manufacturing features in CAD designs.

## MFCAD-VLM Dataset

The study utilizes the [MFCAD-VLM dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/14038050), a comprehensive collection designed to advance research in CAD and AFR. The dataset includes:

- **STEP Files**: CAD models in STEP format, representing various parts with distinct manufacturing features, categorized by complexity levels (easy, medium, and hard).
- **Ground Truth JSON Files**: Expert-annotated JSON files corresponding to each STEP file, detailing manufacturing feature types, quantities, and specifics essential for accurate AFR assessment.
- **Multi-View Isometric Images**: Three isometric-view snapshots per CAD model, generated via Python, capturing different viewing angles to aid feature recognition tasks.


## Installation
